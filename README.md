# Cards-Game

# Project Overview
The Memory Card Game is a client-side web application designed to simulate the classic card-matching game. Players interact with a grid of face-down cards and attempt to find matching pairs by flipping two cards at a time.

# Key Features

Dynamic card grid rendered in the browser

Card flip logic with match and mismatch detection

State management to track revealed and matched cards

Restart functionality to reset game state and reshuffle cards

Responsive layout compatible with desktop and mobile browsers

# Technologies Used

HTML5 for structure

CSS3 for layout and animations

Vanilla JavaScript for game logic and DOM interaction

This project focuses on reinforcing core JavaScript concepts such as conditional logic, event listeners, and UI state control without relying on external libraries or frameworks.
